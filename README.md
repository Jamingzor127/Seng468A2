To set up the nginx server, the three apis, redis, mongo, and kafka. You simply have to run `docker-compose up` from the root of this project. This will automatically build and start all necessary services. The nginx server runs on `localhost:5001`, mongo runs on `localhost:27017`, and the kafka UI runs on `localhost:8080`. The kafka UI can be used to see the current state of the Kafka cluster. 

The api is built with NestJS and uses Swagger. This means that by going to `localhost:5001/api` you will access a page that allows you to easily run supported api calls against the api. Calling get on `localhost:5001` will return the hostname of the server that was called (it should be different every time as the servers as in a round robin configuration)

There is a directory called `seed-files` in this project. It is in here you are able to run commands to generate data for the database. This script hits the apis to create all the necessary data. To run this, simply navigate to the `seed-files` directory and run `npm run seed` (node_modules and dist are already built for you, you will need node to run this though). This will generate all the data and return user reports for each user into `<root>/seed-files/dist/reports` in a json format
